# MCVAE and FMCVAE Analysis Report

This repository contains an associated code to the report inspired by the article *"Monte Carlo Variational Auto-Encoders"* by Achille Thin, Nikita Kotelevskii, Alain Durmus, Maxim Panov, Eric Moulines, and Arnaud Doucet. The work presented here introduces a novel extension termed **FMCVAE**.

## Overview

In this repository you will find:

- **Source Code:** Implementation details and scripts used to reproduce the experiments.
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for visualizing and understanding model performance.
- **Novel Methods:** Code of FMCVAE, a novel method building upon MCVAE

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for model implementations and experiment scripts.
- **`results_visual/`**: Jupyter notebooks for visualization of discrepancy of the different methods.
- **`toy_examples/`**: Jupyter notebooks for visualization of discrepancy of the different methods.
- **`data/`**: Sample datasets for training and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Novel Contribution: FMCVAE

This repository also introduces **FMCVAE**, an extension of the MCVAE framework. Key features include:

- **Enhanced Architecture:** Modified model architecture aimed at improved performance and efficiency.
- **Extended Experiments:** Additional experiments demonstrating the advantages of FMCVAE over the standard MCVAE.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Notebook-based visualizations to explore the latent spaces and learning dynamics of the models.
